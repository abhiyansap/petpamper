    <!-- Steps for Trimming -->
    <div>
      <h2>Step 1: Coat Assessment</h2>
      <p>Our grooming experts begin by assessing your pet's coat to understand the level of shedding and identify problem areas.</p>
    
      <h2>Step 2: Brushing</h2>
      <p>We use specialized de-shedding tools to carefully brush and remove loose fur from your pet's coat. This helps prevent matting and tangling.</p>
    
      <h2>Step 3: Bathing</h2>
      <p>A thorough bath with high-quality de-shedding shampoo helps to loosen the undercoat and remove additional loose fur, promoting a healthy coat.</p>
    
      <h2>Step 4: Conditioning Treatment</h2>
      <p>We apply a nourishing conditioner to your pet's coat to moisturize and strengthen the fur, reducing future shedding and promoting a shiny, healthy coat.</p>
    
      <h2>Step 5: Blow Drying</h2>
      <p>Your pet is carefully blow-dried to remove any remaining loose fur. This step also helps to fluff the coat and leave it looking clean and vibrant.</p>
    
      <h2>Step 6: Final Brushing and Inspection</h2>
      <p>We perform a final brush to ensure all loose fur has been removed. Our groomers inspect the coat for any irregularities and make sure your pet looks and feels great.</p>
    
      <h2>Step 7: De-shedding Recommendation</h2>
      <p>Our grooming experts provide personalized recommendations to help you manage shedding between grooming sessions, including tips on at-home brushing and maintenance.</p>
