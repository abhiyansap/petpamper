    <!-- Steps for Trimming -->
    <div>
      <h2>Step 1: Gentle Introduction</h2>
      <p>Our experienced groomers begin the ear cleaning process with a gentle introduction, allowing your pet to become familiar with the surroundings and the grooming professional.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 2: Inspection of Ear Health</h2>
      <p>Prior to cleaning, we conduct a careful inspection of your pet's ears. This involves checking for signs of redness, swelling, discharge, or any abnormalities that may indicate ear issues.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 3: Pre-Cleaning Assessment</h2>
      <p>Our groomers assess the amount of earwax and debris present in the ears. This information helps determine the appropriate cleaning solution and method to use for your pet's specific needs.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 4: Selection of Cleaning Solution</h2>
      <p>Based on the assessment, a veterinarian-approved ear cleaning solution is selected. We prioritize solutions that are gentle, effective, and suitable for your pet's ear health.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 5: Application of Cleaning Solution</h2>
      <p>The chosen cleaning solution is applied to a sterile cotton ball or pad. Our groomers gently and carefully insert the cotton into the ear canal, ensuring thorough coverage without causing discomfort.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 6: Massaging for Even Distribution</h2>
      <p>To facilitate the cleaning process, our groomers massage the base of the ears. This helps distribute the cleaning solution evenly and encourages the loosening of earwax and debris.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 7: Exterior Ear Cleaning</h2>
      <p>The visible part of the ear (pinna) is gently cleaned using a soft cloth or cotton ball. This step focuses on removing any dirt or debris present on the outer surface of the ears.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 8: Ear Canal Cleaning</h2>
      <p>Using specialized tools and techniques, our groomers carefully clean the ear canal. We ensure thorough removal of earwax and debris while avoiding any harm to the delicate structures of the ear.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 9: Inspection Post-Cleaning</h2>
      <p>After the cleaning process, we conduct a post-cleaning inspection to confirm that the ears are clear of any residual cleaning solution and to ensure there are no signs of irritation or discomfort.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 10: Positive Reinforcement and Comfort</h2>
      <p>Throughout the ear cleaning session, positive reinforcement techniques are applied to keep your pet comfortable. Treats and gentle praise are used to create a positive association with the grooming experience.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 11: Client Communication</h2>
      <p>Our groomers provide feedback on the condition of your pet's ears and offer guidance on at-home care between grooming sessions. We are committed to transparent communication regarding your pet's ear health.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <h2>Step 12: Next Appointment Scheduling</h2>
      <p>To maintain optimal ear health, we recommend scheduling regular ear cleaning appointments. Consistent grooming contributes to the prevention of ear-related issues and ensures the well-being of your pet.</p>
